# Colorandom - Group Project

## Deploy link

## Project Overview

### A group project dedicated to writing HTML and CSS, and leverage JavaScript to both create your data model and interact with the DOM. Build upon collaborating in a group by honing in on skills such as communication, planning, git and GitHub workflow.  Created a random color generator with the following functionality:
- When the page loads, we should see a title, 5 colors labeled with their hex codes, an unlocked emoji next to each hex code
  - two buttons: New Palette and Save Palette and a section for displaying saved palettes as an accordion
- Every time the user clicks the New Palette button, a new set of colors is generated and displayed
- When the user clicks the Save Palette button, the saved palette should show up in the saved palette side of the UI
  - a button to delete the palette will be rendered next to the saved palettes
- A user should be able to click a color in the palette and lock it
  - The open lock icon/emoji should change to be locked icon/emoji to indicate the color is now locked
- When the New Palette button is clicked, all the colors update as expected, except any colors that are locked
- A user should be able to unlock colors and continue updating colors with the New Palette button as expected
- When a saved palette's delete button or trash can is clicked, that palette is removed from the page
